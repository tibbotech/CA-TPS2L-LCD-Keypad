# TPS2L LCD and Keypad Demo

This demo runs on the TPS2L device and demonstrates the use of the LCD, sensor keypad, signal strength LEDs, and the buzzer.

Make sure you are running the latest TIDE, then open and run this project. Touching keys will draw rectangles of different colors. Also, each time you press a key the TPS2L will beep and switch one of the signal strength LEDs on.
